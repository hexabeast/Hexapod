Things needed to build the robot:

- A 3D Printer
- 2 LEGO Technic Steel Ball Caster
- 21 servos (standard size, like the MG996R on Amazon)
- A Raspberry Pi 2
- A Breadboard and wires
- 18650 battery cases and batteries (2x3.7V)
- Any slim portable smartphone battery (for the Pi)

You also need to install pi-blaster ( https://github.com/sarfata/pi-blaster ), and ffmpeg on the Raspberry Pi, and put the content of the "code" folder in your home directory. 
Configure the Pi to launch the "launch.sh" script on boot, and it should work.
